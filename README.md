# Welcome to SRCT!

Student-Run Computing and Technology (SRCT, pronounced "circuit") is a student organization at George Mason University which enhances student computing at our school by developing and maintaining systems that provide specific services for Mason's community. We were founded in 2011 to be a place where students could work together, share their knowledge, and build really neat projects for the benefit of everyone at Mason, as well as run a host of events to help get students involved.

Whether you're looking to contribute to one of our web projects or just find a group of people who love technology to hang out with, there's lots of ways be involved in SRCT.

## Slack

Regardless of how you plan to participate, you need to join the SRCT Slack! Slack is an online communication platform, and we use it for everything. On Slack, we plan our meetings, plan meetups, work on our projects, and just chat. Signup for an account using your GMU email address at https://srct.slack.com/signup, then once you're in, say hi!

## Getting involved

### Meetings

A great first step into SRCT is to attend our meetings. We host weekly meetings on Monday's at 6pm where we invite guest speakers, run techincal workshops, play board games, or just hang out and work on our projects. Check our website calendar at https://srct.gmu.edu to see when the next meeting is.

### Planning

Lots of work goes into planning our meetings and events. If you want to make an impact on the org but aren't interested in contributing to our technical projects, helping to plan events is a great way to do that! To start, hang out at our meetings or post in Slack that you're interested and we'll get you involved.

## Projects

The main focus of our org is building software to benefit the Mason community. Hopefully you've used some of our software already, such as [Schedules](https://schedules.gmu.edu), [What's Open](https://whatsopen.gmu.du), or [Go](https://go.gmu.edu). We're always looking to add new features, improve existing features, and fix bugs in our software, so new contributors are always welcome. To get started contributing, please follow our inital setup guides for your operating system:

- [Windows](https://git.gmu.edu/srct/welcome/blob/master/initial-setup-windows.md)
- [Mac](https://git.gmu.edu/srct/welcome/blob/master/initial-setup-mac.md)
- Linux (TODO: for now, we recommend following the Mac guide but using your distro's package manager instead of Homebrew.)

Once you've gotten setup, there's a few crucial technologies you need to be familiar with before you can start contributing.

### Command Line

When working on any kind of software project, you're going to need to navigate around, run commands, and get yourself out of trouble on the command line. Learning the basics will take you far. If you're already familiar, feel free to skip ahead. If not, please complete the [DjangoGirls Introduction to command line](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/intro_to_command_line/). This will get you up to speed with the basics.

**NOTE**: if you're on Windows, use Git Bash to complete the tutorial and follow the OSX/Linux instructions. You'll use Git Bash to contribute to our projects so it's best to learn that instead of the default windows interface.

### Git Workflow

Git is the industry standard for version control, and it's what we use to manage our projects. Git is a necessary skill for software developement as it allows you to collaberate efficiently and effictively with other developers while building software.

Here is a quick overview of the workflow we use for working on our projects with Git.

### 1. Clone the project

This is described in more detail in each project's README.
